# Advent of Code 2023

Run a specific day with `cargo run [day number]` (eg. `cargo run 5`).

Run all solutions so far with `cargo run all`.

Run with one of the formats listed above followed by `-v` to get more info about
time taken (e.g. `cargo run all -v`).

Run with just `cargo run` to read the day number from stdin.
